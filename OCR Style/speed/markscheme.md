<p>&nbsp;Award bullet 4 even if bullet 3 is wrong. Do not award if outputting orriginal input value.</p>
  <p><code>input = value</code> is not correct. variable must be on the left.</p>
<p>Bullet 5 is dependent on bullet 4.</p>
<p>Input must be stored e.g <code>user input</code> - no mark</p>
<p>Outputs MUST have " " around strings and not around variable names.</p>
<p>If bullet 4 is not given as variable is inside of " ", still award bullet 6 if correct.</p>
  <p><code>numberSecs = input("Enter the time in seconds")</code> would get both bullets 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Concatenation is not required for the final bullet</p>
  <p><code>input("Seconds")</code> would get 1 mark for outputting seconds, it would not get bullet 2.&nbsp;</p>
